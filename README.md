# JSON Data Store

This server allows you to create, read, update, and delete JSON data.

It's basically a specialized type of object store that is greatly simplified,
meant for aiding in testing and development of RESTful APIs.

The motivation behind this server is to enable quick testing of frontend
applications that need to interact with a RESTful backend.
